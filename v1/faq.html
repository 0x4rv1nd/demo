        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>Is my money safe?</h2>
        <p>Yes, once you receive a confirmation that we are processing your payment the transaction is finalized. It cannot be canceled by either party.</p>

        <h2>Can the transaction be canceled once it’s been sent?</h2>
        <p>No, once a payment has been sent it cannot be canceled. This is why we ask you to always verify the recipient details.</p>

        <h2>There’s a hold on my transaction, what if I need the money urgently?</h2>
        <p>If you find that you need the money urgently and we have put a hold on the transaction, we recommend finding a solution with the sender to see if there is anything that they can do because we cannot speed up the process times.</p>

        <h2>I usually don’t have a delay when I use Zelle, why is there one now?</h2>
        <p>Due to new banking regulations, it is required by Zelle to have longer processing times when receiving large payments from new parties. This is to ensure we are compliant with all laws and regulations.</p>

        <h2>Why don’t I see the transaction in my bank account yet, should I be concerned?</h2>
        <p>No you shouldn’t be concerned, the transaction won’t appear in your bank account until we have processed it fully. We do our best to ensure quality service while being fully complaint with all banking laws.</p>
